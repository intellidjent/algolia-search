<p>The AutoML search engine 2.0 reduces model training time from 2 hours (in 9.1 release) down to only 15 minutes — one more step closer to real-time training of models created to address the ongoing changes in data that modern enterprises must keep up with.</p>
<p>Security is another big theme of the 9.2 release, with filters being added to the Secrets Vault, as well as more tools available to analyze code and systems for vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Further, Dashboards and Analytics are now optimized for faster updates and loading, providing users with even quicker access to the insights they are seeking.</p>
<p>Additionally, more capabilities were added and improved, such as Studio enhancements, OCR for Windows, and more.</p>

<p>Previously, all Secrets Vault entries were visible to all users in Control Tower. For security reasons, Secrets Vault now offers standard SPA filtering, already used for all entities in Control Tower. Users can create their filter rule based on Alias (name of the secret entry) and limit visibility of secret entries that fall under this rule to certain user groups.</p>
<p>Filters are very helpful when multiple teams use the same Control Tower environment. Now, secret entries are available only to users authorized to access them for business purposes, and hidden from the others. This helps to protect secure information and control its distribution.</p>
<p>In addition to this, users can filter entries to narrow down the search for a required entry in a large list. Learn more about Using Filters for Collaborative Work.</p>

<p>Sticking to one of the major goals of 9.2—namely, performance—AutoML models were improved by applying new advanced search algorithms. This significantly reduces the time to search the best components combination — <strong>from 2 hours to just 15 minutes</strong> per field without compromising the quality.</p>
<p>Given that frequent changes of input require constant re-training, this optimization is a major step toward <strong>real-time training</strong>.</p>

<p>AutoML SDK extended its range of post-processing capabilities by adding a number of out-of-the-box normalizers. These are the commonly used normalizers added in 9.2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normalizers for handling uppercase and lowercase, as well as capitalization: LowerCaseNormalizer, UpperCaseNormalizer, CapitalizeNormalizer.<br>
For example, the following transformation: &quot;caliFornia&quot; → &quot;California&quot; can be performed by applying two normalizers that handle lowercase and capitalization.</li>
<li>Normalizers for replacing, trimming and removing characters: PatternReplacerNormalizer, TrimmerNormalizer, HtmlSpecialCharactersRemoverNormalizer.<br>
For example, &quot;100€&quot; → &quot;100&quot; transformation by applying a normalizer that removes special HTML characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed information, refer to Normalizer Javadocs.</p>

WorkFusion Studio
Studio enhancements aim for more stable and convenient work both for business users and developers. Object recording covers more cases from user feedback, including a bunch of improvements when inspecting/recording in Windows (cmd, Start Menu components, Calculator) and a number of applications (Excel, Outlook, SwingSet, Total Commander).</p>
<p>To avoid possible confusion, disabled actions with no functionality were removed from the Actions Library. See more in Actions Library for WorkFusion Studio.</p>
<p>Excel Automation
Excel actions were improved, thus broadening the capabilities of Excel scripts execution.</p>
<p>The Get Cell Value action for Excel is enabled to work for calculated values (formulas).</p>
<p>Numeric value can be set into an Excel cell in Number format.
Fixed number variables for Excel actions are parsed in Big Decimal format (not in Scientific as before).
See more about Excel automation in Actions Library for WorkFusion Studio.</p>
<p>Inspector
Inspector was improved for more effective work by simplifying and accelerating the exploring properties and values of the target objects.</p>
<p>Inspector supports collections of selectors corresponding to the search criteria. The feature is especially useful when inspecting similar elements in tables or lists for further automation. The Selector field now has Back &quot;&lt;&quot; and Forward &quot;&gt;&quot; arrows to switch between elements and choose the required selector.</p>
<p>Inspector guarantees selector uniqueness to ensure the selected UI control is clicked during the script execution. When selecting the element, the user explicitly sees its unique selector with a &quot;1 of 1&quot; match.</p>
<p>CSS selector is introduced as the most brief and clearly expressed one. The Type filter enables the user to choose between either an Object or a CSS selector. When selecting the needed type, the selector string is rebuilt to match the given notation.</p>
<p>In case an &quot;Access denied&quot; error is detected (for example, a process is run under the Admin permissions), the user is notified to either run Inspector as Administrator or disable the user account control to continue inspecting the selected application.</p>
<p>See more about Inspector.</p>
<p>Robotics API
API improvements contribute to easier and faster work with complex use cases.</p>
<p>When scripting in the Code perspective, the user can find window handles by their attributes: class, title, etc. Three new attributes have been introduced — parentPID, processName, commandLine. With this improvement, script execution accelerates for cases with multiple windows: 18 times faster for 8 windows and 36 times faster for 16 windows. See code examples in Finding Window Handles by Criteria.
Process ID can be identified when starting a program. That makes it handy in case the user needs to know and save the ID of the process created by the open command. For example, to detect all child windows of the opened application and perform further actions with them. See more in Identifying Process ID.
Clicking on a UI component with offset facilitates automating complex controls like trees or tables with checkboxes, where a click is done not only in the center of the element, but somewhere else (say, the top-left corner or custom offset). The feature is valid for any mouse click (double, triple, wheel) with offset counted from top left and works for desktop automation only. Learn more about Clicking on Element with Offset.</p>
<p>ABBYY OCR Checkmarks API for Windows
Previously OCR capabilities in SPA were available only on Linux machines. Now, ABBYY OCR on Windows is deployed in SPA with a full set of features available on Linux: REST API endpoints, Barcode Recognition, etc. Besides this, OCR on Windows offers Optical Mark Recognition, specifically designed for checkmarks. OCR on Windows machines has a robust infrastructure with a possibility of horizontal scaling for OCR throughput increase. Learn How To Recognize Checkmarks and more about OCR on Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>Other Improvements
RPA Installation on 32-bit
RPA Server can now be installed on Windows 7 32-bit environment.</p>
<p>Only manual installation is supported. See more in the RPA Server Installation on Windows 7 32-bit guide.</p>
<p>AutoML SDK Wizard
AutoML SDK Wizard enhancements include:</p>
<p>Display of model default values for secured repository.
Ability to save Server Profile if a user is offline.
Improved wizard performance with local archetype catalog.
Switching to Java perspective by default.
Configurable Bot Manager Timeout
A new feature enables to modify Bot Manager timeout. It is used to provide more time for execution, for example, when the number of threads for a business process step is bigger than the number of available bots. See how to configure Bot Manager timeout in Bot Manager.</p>
<p>Drag and Drop Automation
Automating web applications is made easier with drag and drop actions. For the feature to work as expected, it is recommended to edit code in the bot task. See code workaround in Automating Drag and Drop.</p>

<p>Installation
Centralized Log Aggregation
Components of the system generate a multitude of logs distributed over different sources and locations. To analyze and solve problems in the most effective and timely way, these logs need to be gathered in one place. Previously, users had to determine the necessary log sources, then manually export selected logs one by one. Now execution of simple command is enough to get relevant logs for any day, component or server.</p>
<p>Filebeat is used for automatic log forwarding, and Logstash for log storage. All application logs from all servers of SPA environment (APP, DB, OCR, AutoML, RPA, BI) are seamlessly pushed to the APM server. Users can set log level for all SPA components before installation using a variable (prod or dev).</p>
<p>Default log level is prod, unless set otherwise by the user before installation. Only error messages and warnings are displayed for the most heavy production log sources.</p>
<p>Learn more about Working with Logs.</p>
<p>Effective log aggregation helps to accelerate troubleshooting and reduces system's idle time during incidents from days to hours.</p>
<p>Other Improvements
Default nginx ports for DB, APP, OCR, and APM servers are changed from 8080/8443 to 80/443. Added a redirect from 80 to SSL port (by default 443).
loader.sh script was improved to remove accidental spaces at the end of lines in properties files during the update of Secret Vault entries.
Embedded Health-Check business process now includes an additional check for AutoML components. See Environment Health Check section.
It is now possible to update MySQL admin password and Java TrustStore password during the normal upgrade procedure.
Multi-user functionality is now available for Object Storage (Minio s3 emulator).
